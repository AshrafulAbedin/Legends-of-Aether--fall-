# 🎮 Legends of Aether — Fall  
### *A College OOP Project Showcase*

> Built to demonstrate mastery of Object-Oriented Programming concepts in C++/Java/Python (specify your language).

This project is a **2D fantasy-themed game prototype** created as part of my coursework to apply and showcase core **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles — including encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and design patterns.

Think of it as *“Hollow Knight meets academic rigor.”* 😊

## 🎯 Objective

To design and implement a modular, extensible game architecture using OOP best practices — proving I can:

- Structure code using classes and objects
- Use inheritance to model game entities
- Apply polymorphism for dynamic behavior
- Manage object relationships and states
- Keep code clean, reusable, and scalable

## 🏗️ OOP Design Highlights
| **Encapsulation** | Private member variables + public getters/setters        |
| **Inheritance**   | `Enemy` → `BossEnemy`, `MinionEnemy`                     |
| **Polymorphism**  | `attack()` behaves differently for Sword vs MagicWand    |
| **Abstraction**   | Abstract `Enemy` and `Weapon` classes define interface   |
| **Composition**   | `Player` HAS-A `Inventory`, `Weapon`, `Stats`            |
